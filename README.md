# WiFree

An Android app to test for the default password vulnerability in Cisco routers provided by UPC. It is based on the [research of Search Lab](http://www.search-lab.hu/advisories/secadv-20150720).

This is for educational and research purpose only! Connecting to someone's network without prior authorization is illegal (in most countries).

The app is in a very early stage of development, so feel free to contribute.
